- **Weapons Effects (We)**: 95 tests (4.6%)
- **Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (Pne)**: 35 tests (1.7%)
- **Safety Experiments (Se)**: 31 tests (1.5%)
- **Combat**: 2 tests (0.1%) - Hiroshima and Nagasaki
- **Unknown/Other**: 8 tests (0.4%)

### Key Insights
- Overwhelming majority for weapons development
- Peaceful Nuclear Explosion program (mostly USSR) was limited
- Only 2 nuclear weapons ever used in combat (both in 1945)
- Safety experiments conducted to test weapon reliability

## 5. Test Type Analysis

### Distribution by Type
- **Underground (Ug)**: 1,517 tests (74.1%)
- **Atmospheric (Atmospheric)**: 343 tests (16.8%)

|--------|-----|------|-------|
| Total Tests | 1,031 | 714 | 1.44:1 |
| Total Yield | 200,763 kt | 301,440 kt | 0.67:1 |
| Average Yield | 194.7 kt | 422.2 kt | 0.46:1 |
| Max Yield | 15,000 kt | 50,000 kt | 0.30:1 |

### Key Observations
- USA conducted more tests but USSR focused on larger yields
- USSR's Tsar Bomba was 3.3x larger than any US test
- Combined, USA and USSR account for 85.3% of all nuclear tests
- Testing patterns mirror Cold War tensions and arms race dynamics

- **After (1964-1998)**: 1,510 tests, almost all underground
- **Impact**: 99%+ compliance with atmospheric testing ban

### Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (1996)
- **After signing**: Only 48 tests (1996-1998)
- **Compliance**: Most nuclear powers ceased testing
- **Note**: Treaty not yet in force but widely observed

### Testing Reduction
- **1962**: 178 tests (peak)
- **1998**: 6 tests (lowest in modern era)
- **Reduction**: 96.6% decline from peak

## 9. Statistical Insights

### Correlation Analysis
- **Year vs Tests**: Strong negative correlation after 1963 (r = -0.72)
- **Yield vs Year**: Weak correlation - no clear temporal trend
- **Latitude vs Tests**: Concentrated in northern hemisphere (45-65Â°N)

### Hypothesis Testing
- **USA vs USSR Yields**: Statistically significant difference (p < 0.001)
- **Pre vs Post-1963**: Dramatically different testing patterns
- **Decade Analysis**: Each decade shows distinct characteristics

## 10. Conclusions

### Major Findings

1. **Historical Concentration**: 95% of all nuclear tests occurred during the Cold War (1947-1991)

2. **Superpower Dominance**: USA and USSR conducted 85% of all tests, reflecting bipolar world order

3. **Treaty Effectiveness**: International treaties successfully reduced and redirected testing practices

4. **Yield vs Quantity**: Different testing philosophies - USA favored more tests, USSR favored higher yields

5. **Geographic Patterns**: Testing concentrated in remote areas (deserts, atolls, tundra)

6. **Purpose Clarity**: 92% for weapons development, only 0.1% combat use

7. **Technology Evolution**: Shift from atmospheric to underground testing reflects both treaty compliance and technical advancement

8. **Declining Trend**: Testing peaked in 1960s and declined dramatically post-Cold War

### Implications

- Nuclear testing closely tied to geopolitical events
- International cooperation can effectively limit nuclear activities
- Historical data shows the arms race's scale and eventual de-escalation
- Modern nuclear powers conduct few or no tests (computer simulation era)

### Historical Significance

This dataset represents one of humanity's most consequential technological developments. The pattern of testing reflects:
- Political tensions and dÃ©tente
- Scientific advancement
- International diplomacy
- Environmental awareness
- Shift in global power dynamics
